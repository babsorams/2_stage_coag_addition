## Abstract
previous work: Last semester, our group designed and fabricated the experiment apparatus and conducted experiment for both 1 stage and 2 stages coagulant addition. Our data it not enough to come up with a grand conclusion, but the data we generated suggest that there might be trade-off when we switch from 1 stage to 2 stages. Besides, we also made some simplification to our system.


goals & objectives: This semester, our group focused on comparing 1 stage addition with 2 stage addition and carrying on the experiment with different influent turbidities, coagulant dosage and HumicAcid concentration,as well as trying to improve Yingda's coagulant dosage model. Besides, more insight on the particles bond mechanism, flocculation, and geometry of the contact chambers were needed. Eventually, we will try to close the debate of 1 stage vs 2 stage, come up with a conclusion and generate enough data to support it.


what you have accomplished: Up to now we have completed the literature review, and working on apparatus set up.
and future work: We have encountered several problem: the high pressure within the system, leak caused by the poor conection. In next few weeks, we would fix those problem and begin to conduct our experiment.


The research was  based on Yingda's thesis, who studied the effect of humic acid on the coagulant dosing model. Based on the bonding mechanism, it could be hypothesized that two stage coagulant addition would increase the removal efficiency of particles while maintain the coagulant dosage. 

## Introduction

We have to understand the physical and chemical process in flocculation before we can optimal our water treatment process, thus a predictive model which can describe the flocculation process is needed. However, in the past research of AguaClara project team, the model we biult only consider the clay and coagulant in the system, it is kind of useless in engineering appllication because NOM can be found in nearly every surface water resources and some of the groud water resources and the presence of NOM can create a need for increased coagulant doses in drinking water treatment.

So we have to extend the model base on our past research, take the effect of NOM on flocculation into consideration. After study the bond mechanism between clay, humic acid and coagulant, we came up with an assumption that we could add the coagulant separately to save coagulant, because it was assumed that after stage 1, all coagulant would be coated by humic acid, thus the coagulant adds in stage 2 could merely function as an agglomerant then achieved better performance in flocculation process and the aggregation process. After we have the model, we can try to optimal our water treatment process, for example, use the coagulant more efficiently and cut down the operational cost. AguaClara is a engineering project team, so cost is always our concern. 



## Literature Review and Previous Work
Discuss what is already known about your research area based on both external work and that of past AguaClara Teams. Connect your objectives with what is already known and explain what additional contribution you intend to make. Make sure to add APA formatted in-text citations. If you mention the author(s) in your sentence, you can simply give the year of publication.[(Logan et. al. 1987)](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/25043431.pdf?acceptTC=true)

The fundamental objective of the two stage coagulant addition subteam is to research and find out if there are beneficial effects of two stage addition of PaCl. Besides lab research, this requires research from external parties and other AguaClara teams. We investigated the effects of humic Acid in water and how it coagulates, as well as revisiting Yingda Du’s thesis on the 
effects of humic Acid on flocculation. With this background knowledge, this would aid our advancement in our research.

### Observations and a Geometric Explanation of the Effects of Humic Acid on Flocculation
 The general science behind flocculation can be understood by analysing the thesis of the observations and a geometric explanation of the effects of HA flocculation by Yingda Du. The thesis gives a clear layout of why we are using HA as the natural organic matter as well as the chemistry behind the creation of flocs. We are using HA as the exemplary compound to represent dissolved NOM because it is the most commonly found form of NOM in our surroundings.  Clay is used to represent the colloidal solids. As NOM is easily found in our soil and water, it increases our need of coagulant to promote flocculation of dissolved particles in water.  Hence why in our model of the experiment we add humic acid and clay with the coagulant PaCl (polyaluminium chloride). However, there is a cut-off point as to how much coagulant we can add to the raw water for it to be beneficial in the removal of NOM. This observation shows that some NOM become increasingly uncooperative to being removed due to the increased presence of coagulant. 

### Using PACl as neutralizer and coagulant aid
Coagulation is one of the most effective methods to remove fine substances from particles. Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC) is often associated with this process to reduce DBPs precursors. PAC prepolymerized coagulants are highly preferred commercially because of its wide range of targets, such as low dosage, wide pH range, low sensitivity of temperature and low residual meal-ion concentration. The effect of PAC with Calcium Carbonate in removing Humic Acid was significantly efficient comparing to other chemicals, because such combination acts as both alkaline chemical and coagulant agent. Comparing with other coagulant types such as Ferric Acid and Aluminum Sulfate, PAC has a significantly high removal efficiency even at a low dosage. In addition, the removal rate of PAC is higher than that of NaOH as alkaline agent. CaCO3 as coagulant reagent, has a significantly high sedimentation velocity, and the sludge volume is reduced by half comparing to that of NaOH. CaCO3 has the highest rate of removing HA and DOC, as its flock core promoted flock formation. This allowed a shorter settling time for the removal for DOC. In addition, the electrical double layer (EDL) of both PAC surface and HA colloid particles is compressed by Ca2+ ions.

### Effectiveness of Two-Stage Coagulant Addition
Low pressure membrane filtration has been increasing popular in water treatment. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration have problems of ineffectively removing natural organic matter (NOM) and membrane fouling, causing deterioration in performance. The two main mechanisms of the removal of humic substances by hydrolyzing coagulants depends on the pH. At a lower pH, cationic metal species neutralize coagulants and cause precipitation. At higher pH, the species adsorb on amorphous OH- precipitates and then can be removed by sedimentation and filtration. Coagulation membrane can be significantly affected by coagulant conditions such as coagulant type and dose, mix mode, etc.
The optimization of the coagulation process has been studied to achieve the highest membrane filtration performance of coagulation membrane. A two-stage coagulant addition strategy with submerged UF membrane process systems was used to investigate the mechanism of membrane fouling and was compared to the conventional one stage method. A significant drop of residual was observed at a low dose of 0.008w0.015 mM Al, with a relatively constant level of residual level with the increase of dosage afterwards. When alum dosage was set at a ratio of 3:1 during rapid mix stage and half way through the flocculation stage, the same permeate quality at the same overall dose at neutral pH, and two-stage addition had mitigated membrane fouling. The jar tests showed that two-stage produced significantly different floc characteristics when comparing to one-stage, and the average floc size of two-stage was 1.5x that of one-stage. Therefore, two-stage could be beneficial to membrane fouling reduction. In addition, two-stage had also produced flocs with higher fractal dimension and lower effective density, which could be beneficial to the formation of high porosity of cake layer. Under the help of hydroxide precipitates, flocs were connected to form larger and more irregular structure. Therefore, two-stage addition could potentially be a simple and effective approach coagulation process that maintains the high permeability of the membrane

### Procedure
Discuss your experimental procedure. How did you run your experiment? What were you testing? What were the values of relevant parameters?

## Results and Analysis
Present an observation (results), then explain what happened (analysis).  Each paragraph should focus on one aspect of your results. In that same paragraph, you should interpret that result.  
In other words, there should not be two distinct paragraphs, but instead one paragraph containing one result and the interpretation and analysis of this result. Here are some guiding questions for results and analysis:

When describing your results, present your data, using the guidelines below:
* What happened? What did you find?
* Show your experimental data in a professional way.
```python
from aide_design.play import*
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
plt.figure('ax',(10,8))
plt.plot(x,y,'*')
plt.savefig('/Users/jillianwhiting/github/Jillian-Whiting/Images/linear')
plt.show()
```

Figure 1: Captions are very important for figures. Captions go below figures.

After describing a particular result, within a paragraph, go on to connect your work to fundamental physics/chemistry/statics/fluid mechanics, or whatever field is appropriate. Analyze your results and compare with theoretical expectations; or, if you have not yet done the experiments, describe your expectations based on established knowledge. Include implications of your results. How will your results influence the design of AguaClara plants? If possible provide clear recommendations for design changes that should be adopted. Show your experimental data in a professional way using the following guidelines:
* Why did you get those results/data?
* Did these results line up with expectations?
* What went wrong?
* If the data do not support your hypothesis, is there another hypothesis that describes your new data?

\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\item \underline{ON} - ON state of ProCoDa. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned on.
\item \underline{Data Acquisition} - State 3 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump is working and the increment function would increase its value each time when we switch to this state. The data acquisition state usually set to be 2 hours, which is enough for the floc blanket to form.
