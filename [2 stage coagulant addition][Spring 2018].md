## Abstract
**Previous work:** Last semester, our group designed and fabricated the experiment apparatus and conducted experiment for both 1 stage and 2 stages coagulant addition. Our data is not enough to come up with a grand conclusion, but the data we generated suggest that there might be trade-off when we switch from 1 stage to 2 stages. Besides, we also made some simplification to our system.


**Goals & Objectives:** This semester, our group focused on comparing 1 stage addition with 2 stage addition and carrying on the experiment with different influent turbidities, coagulant dosage and humic acid concentration as well as trying to improve Yingda's coagulant dosage model. Besides, more insight on the particles bond mechanism, flocculation, and geometry of the contact chambers were needed. Eventually, we will try to close the debate of 1 stage vs 2 stage, come up with a conclusion and generate enough data to support it.


**What we have accomplished:** Up to now we have completed the literature review, and working on apparatus set up.The research was  based on Yingda's thesis, who studied the effect of humic acid on the coagulant dosing model. Based on the bonding mechanism, it could be hypothesized that two-stage coagulant addition would increase the removal efficiency of particles while maintaining the coagulant dosage.


**Future work:** We have encountered several problems: the high pressure within the system, the leak caused by the poor connection. In next few weeks, we would fix those problems and begin to conduct our experiment. After discussed with Monroe, we suspected that the size of our first contact chamber is not enough for the HA and coag nanoparticles in the synthetic water to generate enough successful collision, so recalculation and test on the CC are also required.




## Introduction

We have to understand the physical and chemical process in flocculation before we can optimize our water treatment process, thus a predictive model which can describe the flocculation process is needed. However, in the past research of AguaClara project team, the model we built only consider the clay and coagulant in the system, it is kind of useless in engineering applications because NOM can be found in nearly every surface water resources and some of the groundwater resources and the presence of NOM can create a need for increased coagulant doses in drinking water treatment.

So we have to extend the model base on our past research, take the effect of NOM on flocculation into consideration. After study the bond mechanism between clay, humic acid, and coagulant, we came up with an assumption that we could add the coagulant separately to save coagulant, because it was assumed that after stage 1, all coagulant would be coated by humic acid, thus the coagulant adds in stage 2 could merely function as an agglomerant then achieved better performance in flocculation process and the aggregation process. After we have the model, we can try to optimize our water treatment process, for example, use the coagulant more efficiently and cut down the operational cost. AguaClara is an engineering project team, so cost is always our concern.


## Literature Review and Previous Work

The fundamental objective of the two stage coagulant addition subteam is to research and find out if there are beneficial effects of two stage addition of PaCl. This would theoretically allow us to use our coagulant more efficiently which would consequently also reduce cost. Besides lab research, this requires research from external parties and other AguaClara teams. We investigated the effects of humic Acid in water and how it coagulates, as well as revisiting Yingda Du’s thesis on the effects of humic acid on flocculation. With this background knowledge, this would aid our advancement in our research.

Humic acid is considered natural organic matter, and it is of the final components made after the breakdown of plant and animal decay. It is commonly found in the soil as it promotes a fertility, it is also used as fertilizers. There is an increase in humic acid concentrations in the wet seasons. The most visual issue of humic acid is that it cause water to change colour. However, in the process of creating potable water, the addition of other compounds and elements with humic acid assists the formation of harmful byproducts such as trihalomethane and haloacetic acid.

### Observations and a Geometric Explanation of the Effects of Humic Acid (HA) on Flocculation
  The general science behind flocculation can be understood by analysing the thesis of the observations and a geometric explanation of the effects of HA flocculation by Yingda Du. The thesis gives a clear layout of why we are using HA as the natural organic matter as well as the chemistry behind the creation of flocs. We are using HA as the exemplary compound to represent dissolved NOM because it is the most commonly found form of NOM in our surroundings. Clay is used to represent the colloidal solids. As NOM is easily found in our soil and water, it increases our need of coagulant to promote flocculation of dissolved particles in water.  Hence why in our model of the experiment we add humic acid and clay with the coagulant PaCl (polyaluminium chloride). However, there is a cut-off point as to how much coagulant we can add to the raw water for it to be beneficial in the removal of NOM. This observation shows that some NOM become increasingly uncooperative to being removed due to the increased presence of coagulant. Our understanding behind the lack of floc formation of NOM in the presence of increased coagulant addition is limited, yet it is an area of interest in determining the magnitude of the effect.
Nevertheless, Yingda’s report focuses on the effect on coagulation of humic acid in the form of hydraulic flocculation, with the consideration of the following processes of filtration and sedimentation. Her research is crucial to our subteam as it provides us with a basis of how we should set up our own apparatus, as well as the physics behind the creation of flocs.

### Using PACl as neutralizer and coagulant aid
Coagulation is one of the most effective methods to remove fine substances from particles. Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC) is often associated with this process to reduce DBPs precursors, which is potentially harmful. PACl prepolymerized coagulants are widely preferred because of its wide range of targets, such as low dosage, wide pH range, low sensitivity of temperature and low residual meal-ion concentration (Sudoh et. al., 2015). The effect of PACl with Calcium Carbonate in removing Humic Acid was significantly efficient comparing to other chemicals, because such combination acts as both alkaline chemical and coagulant agent. Comparing with other coagulant types such as Ferric Acid and Aluminum Sulfate, PACl has a significantly high removal efficiency even at a low dosage. In addition, the removal rate of PACl is higher than that of NaOH as alkaline agent.

### Effectiveness of Two-Stage Coagulant Addition
Based on Yingda's Thesis, the presence of humic acid as NOM affects the use of PACl as a coagulant for synthetic surface water, but in a one-stage setting, meaning the coagulant is added at once. Last semester, our model considered the attachment efficiency for the hydraulic flocculation. However, past studies have investigated the difference of efficiency of two-stage coagulant addition, meaning adding the coagulants at two different points, comparing with one-stage. (Liu et. al., 2011) Keeping the total amount of coagulant at the same dosage, when partial amount was affed half-way, it was found that two-stage can produce floc 1.5 times the floc size comparing with one-stage, which potentially made two-stage more efficient to one-stage. As the floc blanket was formed, the flocs were connected together to for larger adn more irregular structure, making two-stage addition more time-efficient than one-stage.

## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
***attention：*** the content about experiment set-up is distributed to the fabriaction and experiment part.

### Experiment
**Step 1.** Make sure the stocks are filled. One stock will have a diluted solution of coagulant and the other will have a solution of water, clay, and humic acid. The concentration depends on the experiment you want to run.


**Step 2.** Once the stocks are ready, the water and wastewater valves are open, the turbidimeters open, and the apparatus completely filled with water, the experiment is now ready to run.

**Step 3.** Be sure to turn on the wastewater pump, next to the effluent turbidimeter, to ensure that the flocs in the weir are transported to the wastewater line. We do not want the flocs to go through the effluent turbidimeter.


**Step 4.** Go to ProCoDa and turn the state from OFF to ON to begin the clay pump so the influent turbidimeter will reach 100 NTU. Once the turbidimeter is steadily at 100 NTU, go back to ProCoDa and turn the stage from ON to Data acquisition state, which will turn on the coagulant pump.
**Step 5.** The Data Acquisition state will go back and forth with the Flush state which is used for second stage addition. The data will be recorded on an excel file to be analyzed later.
**Step 6.** Once the experiment was ran and the data collected, turn off ProCoDa and save the data. Proceed to the cleaning procedure when experimentation is finished.

### Cleaning Procedure
 Once the experiment is done, we want to completely wash out the apparatus so it will be ready for the next experiment.
 **Step 1.** Turn off the clay and coagulant pump while let the tap water pump run at a relative high speed.

**Step 2.** Remove entire apparatus from wall (recirculator \& tube settler) and throughly wash it out, then reattach it back to the wall

**Step 3.** Wash out the Flocculator by unplugging the connection between the the outflow tube from the influent turbidimeter and the flocculator, and plug in tubing from the nearby sink to wash out the flocculator. Make sure there is a bucket at the end of the flocculator that will collect the water.

**Step 4.** Clean the influent and effluent turbidimeter. Make sure to turn on the Bypass channel first! First, open the bypass valve. Second, pinch the black outflow tube. Third, close the inflow valve.

**Step 5.** Remove and wash out the vials from both turbidimeters. Refill the vials with clean water, then put back into the turbidimeters.Use Kim wipes to clean the glass throughly.

**Step 6.** Turn off water to the flocculator and detach the tubing. Hook up the influent turbidimeter back into flocculator then re-open the influent turbidimeter BUT keep the effluent turbidity meter closed. Turn on the water pump to clean out the influent turbidimeter as well as the flocculator.

**Step 7.** Pour out the coagulant reservoir into a different bucket and rinse reservoir with deionized water to make sure all residue is washed out. Take out the push pin then wash out the coagulant reservoir throughly. Replenish reservoir with 5L (or less) of deionized water. Use MathCAD to determine how much 70.9mg/L PAC coagulant needed to use to get the desired results for the experiment.

## Experimental Checklist
Another potential section could include a list of things that you need to check before running an experiment.

## ProCoDA Method File
Use this section to explain your method file. This could be broken up into several components as shown below:

### States
Here, you should describe the function of each state in your method file, both in terms of its overall purpose and also in terms of the details that make it distinct from other states. For example:
\begin{itemize}
<<<<<<< HEAD
***I don't know why the template kept the format of Overleaf***

**{OFF}** - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.

**{ON}** - ON state of ProCoDa. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned on.

**{Data Acquisition}** - State 3 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump is working and the increment function would increase its value each time when we switch to this state. The data acquisition state usually set to be 2 hours, which is enough for the floc blanket to form.

**{Flush}** - State 4 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump stop working, during this stage raw water would run through the system and flush out the floc blanket build in last data acquisition state, so that every data acquisition state would run with same original system condition.

=======
\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
>>>>>>> fbf5fa40cd4f524893523acb3ec20f2ef10e94fb

\item \underline{OFF} - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.
\item \underline{ON} - ON state of ProCoDa. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned on.
\item \underline{Data Acquisition} - State 3 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump is working and the increment function would increase its value each time when we switch to this state. The data acquisition state usually set to be 2 hours, which is enough for the floc blanket to form.
\end{itemize}
### Set Points
<<<<<<< HEAD
**{Turb target}** - This set point has the same value as our target influent turbidity, and would control the clay pump.
**{pump control(clay)}** - use this to decide which pump should we control.

**{Flush Time}** - Duration of the flush state.

**{Data Acquisition Time}** - Duration of the data acquisition state.

**{State to Increment}** - Tell the increment function when to increase its value, in this experiment, we use increment function to control coagulant pump speed.

**{Slope}** - The slope of increment function.

**{Intercept}** - The intercept of increment function.

**{Max x}** - How many time would the increment function work during one circulation.

**{coag pump control}** - use this to decide which coagulant pump should we control.

**{coag pump property}** - Flow rate per revolution.

**{balance}** - Variable with value returned by the electrical balance.


=======
Here, you should list the set points used in your method file and explain their use as well as how each was calculated.
